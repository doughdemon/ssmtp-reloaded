How to install:
---------------

If you are building sSMPT from scratch the following steps worked on a
Fedora Core 1 system.  To install it in the /usr/local directory:

        ./configure
        make
        make install

Then edit the ssmtp.conf file /usr/local/etc/ssmtp.

or to install as the main Mail Transport Agent:

	./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var/lib
	make
	make install-sendmail

Then edit the ssmtp.conf file in /etc/ssmtp. See ssmtp.conf(5) man page
for a description of all configuration options.
